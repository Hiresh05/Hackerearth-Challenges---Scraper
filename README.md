# Hackerearth-Challenges---Scraper

Created a scraper to scrape the data from Hackerearth Challenges page.
Since it is a Javascript rendered webpage, I've used Selenium to fetch all the data.

Tip:  (Install Beautiful Soup and Selenium library ,also install Chrome Driver if you are using Google Chrome or else install Gecko driver for Firefox)
